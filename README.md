# Steam Trains
**Steam Trains** is a [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod adding Fireless Steam Accumulator Locomotives that are powered by steam instead of solid burnable fuel items.

This mod adds a **Steam Locomotive** powered by *steam*. Each locomotive can hold up to 20k units of steam.

The performance of the locomotive depends on the temperature of the steam:

| steam temperature | name              | energy (full locomotive) | acceleration | max speed |
|------------------:|:------------------|-------------------------:|-------------:|----------:|
| 165°C - 315°C     | steam             |       600 MJ             |   120%       |    105%   |
| 315°C - 500°C     | mixed steam       |     1.2 GJ               |   140%       |    105%   |
| 500°C - 1000°C    | superheated steam |     1.94 GJ              |   150%       |    110%   |
